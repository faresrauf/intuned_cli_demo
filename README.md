# Intuned CLI

## Usage Instructions

The Intuned CLI exposes a variaty of commands to develop and create your Intuned projects locally:

### Init a project

`npx -p @intuned/runtime intuned-init`

### Artifacts provided

- `./intuned.json`: Intuned project configuration file
- `./api`: Folder containing the API files
- `./parameters`: Folder containing the parameters files, used for API parameters injection
- `./output`: Folder containing the output files generated by the APIs

### Note:

- You can use either `yarn` or `npm run` to run and execute the commands

### Keys,Environment Variables and Settings

- workspaceId: Your Intuned workspace ID, either provided via command line or Intuned.json setting -> (`workspaceId`)
[How to get your workspaceId](https://docs.intunedhq.com/docs/guides/platform/how-to-get-a-workspace-id)
- projectName: The name of your Intuned project, either provided via command line or Intuned.json setting -> (`projectName`)
- INTUNED_API_KEY: Your Intuned API key, either provided via command line or environment variable

### Running the APIs through development

`yarn run-api` <api-name>

- Options:
  - -i, --parameters-file <file>: JSON file containing API parameters
  - -s, --store-results: Store the results of the running API inside the output directory:
    - ./output/[runId]/results.json
    - ./output/[runId]/extendedPayloads.json

### Building the intuned project

`yarn cli-build`

### Deploying the project

`yarn deploy` <project-name>

- project-name: Optional project name that overrides the one on the intuned.json file
- Options (optinal):
  - --workspace-id: Overrides the workspace id specified in the intuned.json file setting
  - --api-key: Overrides the api key provided by the environment var.

### General Notes:

- You can interact with your Intuned project within the platform when deploying it
- All commands above should be runned from the root location of the project (from where you runned and created the project through `intuned-init` command)
- Verify you're in the correct location by confirming the presence of package.json and intuned.json files
- Running commands from subdirectories may result in errors or unexpected behavior
